          <h2>About the Admin</h2>
          <p>My name is Nina! I'm 23 years old from Southern California, and I've been playing sim games for over 15 years. Along the way, I discovered a passion for coding, graphics, and helping players - all of which led to this little project. I'm currently in school as a biology major, aiming for BA so I can teach. I love languages, KPOP, and the color green. The villain is my favorite character, my hamster is named after an x-wing pilot, and I can recite the entire script of the <i>Once Upon a Time: Skin Deep</i> episode from memory.</p>
          <p><strong>On HP</strong>, I go by the name Mango! My player ID is 1802 and I'm always up for meeting new people and helping out. I'm the breed ambassador for Knabstruppers and Korean Jindo Dogs, and am the regular president of the Layout Design & Coding club. I was previously known as Monstaccato, which is where this site's title came from! You can usually find me on other social media using that handle.</p>

        <p>This is a site filled with odds and ends for players on <a href="https://horsephenomena.com/">Horse Phenomena</a>! I'm Monstaccato (or Mango #1802 on HP), and I've been coding for around 13 years. I've been playing SIM games for over 15 and have been a part of the Horse Phenomena community for the past 5. In late 2018, I decided that I'd like to host a site to help players out! Included are point calculators, with training guides and more on the way!</p>
        <h2>Training Guides</h2>
        <p>I put together information about points earned in shows and using tickets for both upgraded and basic players. These guides should help plan point goals. Check them out [ <a href="/training.html">here</a> ].</p>
        <h2>The Baby Calculator</h2>
        <p>I created The Baby Calculator to help predict the points your baby will be born with. If you enter the exact points from both parents at the time of breeding, you'll receive the exact points of the baby, including awards given right after birth. You can also use the calculator to estimate the points the baby will be born with by entering the point goals of the parents. Check it out [ <a href="/baby-calc.html">here</a> ].</p>
